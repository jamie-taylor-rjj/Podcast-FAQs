# The .NET Core Podcast Interview FAQS

This section of the FAQ document is related specifically to [The .NET Core Podcast](https://dotnetcore.show). As this podcast has a different format to others that RJJ produces, details in other sections may not be relevant if you are a guest for one of the other podcasts.

Please take the time to read through the main FAQs, found at the head of this document before continuing.

## Will I Need To Prepare a Bio?

We appreciate that summarising one’s self in a few sentences can be quite difficult to do. However, We will prepare a basic one for you, based on my research of your online projects or the topic that we will discuss. The version that we supply is entirely changeable. You can either supply a completely different bio, supply amendments (which we will happily make), or approve the version that We have written.

Examples of past bios include:

> In this episode of The .NET Core Podcast, we talk with Jamie Taylor about some of the podcasts that he creates. The list of podcasts that Jamie works on includes [The .NET Core Podcast](https://dotnetcore.show), [The Waffling Taylors](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks), [Tabs and Spaces](https://tabsandspaces.io). He describes himself as a Dad, Podcaster, Developer, and life-long learner. He can be contacted on twitter [@podcasterJay](https://podcasterJay) and invites you to check out his [about.me](https://about.me/thejamietaylor) page.

The above is an example of a bio that we have written, but which was accepted as-is by the interviewee (in this case Jamie Taylor).

## What Kinds Of Questions Will Be Asked?

We see you as an expert in the field that we are discussing with you, as such will be asking you questions about your chosen field and how it relates to either:

- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR
- etc.

(please forgive the impersonal nature of the previous sentence)

As such, we will often ask questions which may seem either leading, rather trivial about the subject matter, or try to relate it to a metaphor or some other technology. In this respect, we are attempting to represent the audience, who may or may not have heard of the technology or field that you are representing.

We will send over a podcast episode planning document, which wil contain a number of questions and topics for the recording. An example set of questions would be:

- Could you please introduce yourself to the listeners?
- Would you mind talking a little about the book that you have written on ASP.NET Core?
- Your blog posts seem to be both incredibly useful and very specific. Are they based on specific issues that you have faced in your everyday development?
- I was wondering if we could talk a little about the ASP NET Core middleware pipeline?
  - how is it different to the way that ASP NET handles requests?
  - how extensible is it? Can listeners create their own middleware classes?

The actual interview will be more free form than just the questions that we send over, they might form the basis of the conversation or they may not even be used. They are also subject to interviewee approval, as such you can choose that we discuss a different branch of the topic, or not cover any of the questions at all.
