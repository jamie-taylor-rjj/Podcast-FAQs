# The Modern .NET Show Interview FAQS

This document contains some of the most frequently asked questions by guests of [The Modern .NET Show](https://dotnetcore.show).

## How Long Will The Interview Last?

We usually ask that guests block out 90-120 minutes of their schedule for the interview, however most interviews will take less than 90 minutes.

The reason that we ask guests to block out that much time is to ensure that we have time for a sound check and a light chat at the beginning of the session, along with a conversation about when we are planning to release the episode at the end of the session.

The entire session should take no longer than around 60 minutes of your time, and the recorded portion of that should be around 40-60 minutes long.

You are free to take as much time as you may need in order to answer a question. Similarly, if you find that you would like to start over with your answer to a question or a topic, you need only ask.

## Will I Receive a Copy Of The Interview Before It Goes Live?

We will contact you once editing is completed and will offer a pre-live version of the episode. This is so that you can go through it and let us know of any further edits you would like our team to make (i.e. `please remove the long "um" at 39 minutes`).

Please note: The majority of "um"s (and similar) will be left in the interview, as it can sound unnatural to remove them all.

We ask that you listen back to the topics and points raised and verify that you have not mentioned something that you are not allowed to (i.e. perhaps you have signed an NDA or know of some industry secrets) - we would prefer to remove any non-public knowledge from our recordings, as we don't want anyone to get into trouble for having appeared on one of our podcasts. This may require you sending the pre-live version of the episode over to company or legal representatives to ensure that nothing needs to be removed.

Our editing team have all signed internal NDAs, as such anything that you request to be removed will not be released to the public and is securely destroyed.

For your peace of mind, we will make a point of announcing that you are answering and raising points as yourself _not_ as a representative of any third party at several points throughout the conversation. This can help remind listeners that we are talking with a person, not the company or group.

As our release schedule is rather agile in its nature, We would need notes back from you as soon as possible. The lead time in releasing to the public RSS feeds is usually a week or so but can be up to two months, as such we will need at least a few days notice for any requested edits. We do not require a lot of information on potential edits, the following (rather impersonal) format is all that is required:

``` plaintext
Here are my requested edits:

38:40 - 39:10 Please remove the name of the new features, they are not ready
27:10 - 27:15 One of my children interrupted us and I use their name
```

We will endeavour to action the edits as soon as we receive them, and they _will_ be actioned before the episode releases.

Please note, however, that due to the agile nature of the show's release, we can only provide on opportunity to send edit requests through. It is also worth noting that, due to the way that services such as Spotify work, any edits required after the episode has released may be difficult to enact.

## Will I Need To Prepare a Bio?

We appreciate that summarising oneâ€™s self in a few sentences can be quite difficult to do. However, we will ask you to provide an "elevator pitch" for yourself near the start of the recording. This is primarily so that the listeners will have a better understanding of who you are and your experience with the topic at hand.

We ask that you have fun with the "elevator pitch", as it can be as professional or relaxed as you would like. We have had guests who talk about their hobbies rather than their professional endeavours, and others who focus on their professional achievements. What you choose to discuss is completely up to you.

An example "elevator pitch" for Jamie (the show's host) might be:

> Hi, I'm Jamie. I'm a Dad, podcaster, mentor, and software developer; I've listed them in the order of most important to me to least. I have a few open-source projects, the most well-known of which is my [OwaspHeaders.Core](https://nuget.org/OwaspHeaders.Core) NuGet package, and I host a number of podcasts: [The Modern .NET Show](https://dotnetcore.show), [The Waffling Taylors](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks), [Tabs and Spaces](https://tabsandspaces.io). I can be found on Twitter/X as [@podcasterJay](https://podcasterJay) (DMs are open) and if you're interested in software development or podcast consultation, please check out [my company](https://rjj-software.co.uk).

## What Kinds Of Questions Will Be Asked?

We see you as an expert in the field that we are discussing with you, as such will be asking you questions about your chosen field and how it relates to either:

- .NET
- ASP .NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR
- Software development patterns and techniques
- Azure / AWS / Cloud provided technologies
- NuGet packages
- etc.

(please forgive the impersonal nature of the previous sentence)

As such, we will often ask questions which may seem either leading, rather trivial about the subject matter, or try to relate it to a metaphor or some other technology. In this respect, we are attempting to represent the audience, who may or may not have heard of the technology or field that you are representing.

We will send over a podcast episode planning document, which wil contain a number of questions and topics for the recording. An example set of questions would be:

- Could you please introduce yourself to the listeners?
- Would you mind talking a little about the book that you have written on ASP.NET Core?
- Your blog posts seem to be both incredibly useful and very specific. Are they based on specific issues that you have faced in your everyday development?
- I was wondering if we could talk a little about the ASP NET Core middleware pipeline?
  - how is it different to the way that ASP NET handles requests?
  - how extensible is it? Can listeners create their own middleware classes?

The actual interview will be more free form than just the questions that we send over, they might form the basis of the conversation or they may not even be used. They are also subject to interviewee approval, as such you can choose that we discuss a different branch of the topic, or not cover any of the questions at all.
