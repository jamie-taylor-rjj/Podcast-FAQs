# The Waffling Taylors Podcast Interview FAQS

This section of the FAQ document is related specifically to [The Waffling Taylors Podcast](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks). As this podcast has a different format to others that RJJ produces, details in other sections may not be relevant if you are a guest for one of the other podcasts.

Please take the time to read through the main FAQs, found at the head of this document before continuing.

## How Long Will The Interview Last?

We usually ask that guests block out 90-120 minutes of their schedule for the interview, however most interviews will take less than 90 minutes.

The reason that we ask guests to block out that much time is to ensure that we have time for a sound check and a light chat at the beginning of the session, along with a conversation about when we are planning to release the episode at the end of the session.

As this show is rather relaxed in nature, and we expect and encourage tangents and exploration of silly ideas, we expect that recording sessions to last a little longer than the other shows we produce. Some of our longest recording sessions have run past the three hour mark (these have been edited down to 60 minute episodes when released), so we are happy to run longer than planned if the mood and conversation takes us in that direction.

Because recordings for this show can run a little longer than most, we understand that a break might be required. If you require a break (bio/bathroom or otherwise) let us know and we'll take a break immediately.

You are free to take as much time as you may need in order to raise a point or answer a question.. Similarly, if you find that you would like to start over with your answer to a question or a topic, you need only ask.

## Will I Need To Prepare a Bio?

The Waffling Taylors podcast is a completely informal discussion based podcast. As such, we would appreciate a bio, but may not use it as we will ask you introduce yourself to the listeners - if you have not appeared on episodes in the past.

If you do provide a bio, we will work it into our introduction of the podcast.

## What Kinds Of Episodes Will There Be?

We have done "standard" episodes (see: [What Kinds Of Questions Will Be Asked?](#what-kinds-of-questions-will-be-asked) for a list of segments in those episodes), and have also done more themed episodes. The themed episodes have often been one of the following topics:

- Discussing a video game film
- An interview with a developer/designer
- Discussing an in-person event
- Discussing a specific game or console
- Mini console dream line-ups

These themed episodes are very specific in nature. For instance the [Waffling Taylors Goes To The Movies](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/categories/waffle-movies/) series is where we watch a video game related film (offline) and discuss it during the episode. For these episodes, we usually rate the film on the following criteria:

- As the genre of film that it targets (i.e. action, horror, etc.)
- As a video game film
- As a film version of the game property that it uses

The following three rating are used for each criteria:

- Love it (best)
- Try it
- Fling it into a tree (worst)

Whereas the [Mini console dream line-ups](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/mini-console-dream-line-ups/) are where we posit the question:

> Imagine that you have an unlimited budget (to deal with licensing issues), and could go through the games on the mini console and replace the ones that you’ll never play with ones from your dream line up. Which games would be included?

We have covered two of the real mini console products which have been released (i.e [Playstation Classic](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/mini-console-dream-line-ups/playstation-classic/) and [Mega Drive Mini](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/mini-console-dream-line-ups/mega-drive/)), but have also talked about our top [Sega Saturn](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/2018/06/22/time-cast-pod-machine-part-three/) and [Sega Dreamcast](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/2020/03/27/dreamcast-year-one-with-andrew-dickinson/) titles in the past.

## What Kinds Of Questions Will Be Asked?

The show is related to video games, both retro and contemporary, the industry, and the related areas of pop culture (video game related films and music, books, conferences and expos, etc.), as such our main topics of conversation will be related to video games.

There are a few recurring segments however, these are:

- What have you been playing?
- The Thunderplain Games
- Get Control of Yourself

Not all of these segments will be included in every episode, but should you wish to have a specific segment then please let us know.

These are outlined below.

### What have you been playing?

This segment is a round robin discussion of a subset of the video games that you have been playing recently. We usually limit this to two or three of the video games that you have played through in the past month or two. We each discuss the games that we have played recently, what we thought of them, and whether we'd recommend others on the show (and the listeners) try them out. You can be as detailed as you would like in your descriptions of the games, but we will point out that we like to limit this segment to around 30 minutes and that we're not asking for a review of the game.

### The Thunderplain Games

We describe this segment as similar to [Desert Island Discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs) but with a twist. We will present you with a completely fantastical scenario:

> Imagine that you are in Final Fantasy X, and the [Thunder Plains](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Plains_(Final_Fantasy_X)) is a place that you get banished to. And what we’re going to do is we’re going to open a portal to the Thunder Plains and, very nicely and politely, boot you through it. You will get help, maybe it will be tomorrow, maybe it will be in a week, maybe it will be in an hour.

> To stop you from getting bored, we’ve said that we’ll keep the portal open and we’ll throw through up to three video games and everything you need to play them - including an Internet connection. The only rules are that you can’t ask for help, because help is on the way, and you can’t tell anyone that you’re in the Thunder Plains.

And we will ask you which games you would likely take with you and why. We ask that you limit this to between three and five games, as we usually limit this segment to around 30 minutes.

### Get Control of Yourself

This segment is based on a tweet from friend of the show Brian [@SinceSpaces](https://twitter.com/sincespacies):

> Get a control of yourself!!!!!! What's been your most fav controller of all time...

> (and what controller bites the big one?)

[link to the original tweet](https://twitter.com/sincespacies/status/1012328593630773248)

In this segment, we are looking for a conversation about which controller (or controllers) you think are the best and which are the worst. We're hoping to spark a conversation about not just the aesthetics of video game controllers, but perhaps a dose of nostalgia about those controllers.
